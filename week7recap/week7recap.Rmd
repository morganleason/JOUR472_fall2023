## Loading the packages

Run the codeblock below to load the packages we will need for this recap

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
```

## Load Data

Run the codeblock below to load the data.

```{r}
earthquakes <- read_csv('https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.csv')

#Setting time column as datetime
earthquakes <- earthquakes |> mutate(time = as_datetime(time))
```

#### Answer the questions below

Most questions have a code block and a space for an answer below. Write the code you think is necessary and, in the answer space, write out what you did and what was the result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q1** Do you notice anything different with this read_csv()? Particularly in the file name?

**A1: The file name appears similarly to the URL for a website. Otherwise, the formatting is the same.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q2** How many records there are there in this dataset? What do they mean and what useful information we can gather from it, looking at the columns?

**A2: The records indicates the number of earthquakes, which is 9,775. We can gather information about how many earthquakes occur monthly based on the data, which could give insight into weather patterns.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q3** How do I reorganize this list to see the ones that are the deepest first? What is the depth that shows up for the deepest one, and its magnitude?

```{r}
earthquakes |> arrange(desc(depth))
```

**A3: The depth that shows up as the deepest is 669.9820. The magnitude is 4.20.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q4** I just want to see the earthquakes with a magnitude larger than 6. How do I do that? And how many are there that fit this criteria?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(mag > 6)
```

**A4: 12 earthquakes have a magnitude greater than 6.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q5** What about if I want to see earthquakes that have both a magnitude larger than 6 and a depth smaller than 20? How many are there in the data set that fit [both]{.underline} these criteria?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(mag > 6 & depth < 20)
```

**A5: Five earthquakes fit this criteria.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q6** What about if I want to see earthquakes that either have a magnitude larger than 6 and a depth smaller than 20? How many are there in the data set that fit [either]{.underline} of these criteria?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(mag > 6 | depth < 20)
```

**A6: 7,413 earthquakes fit this criteria.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q7** I'm interested in finding earthquakes that took place in Alaska. Which column should I look at? How do I use it to find all the earthquakes in Alaska? How many earthquakes took place there?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(str_detect(place, 'Alaska'))
```

**A7: 3,423 earthquakes took place in Alaska.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q8** I notice that there is a column called 'type', that seems to have different kinds of tremors. What is the best way to find what are all the possible types of tremors, and counting how many of each there are in this data set? What are the first two most common types of tremors in this data set?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  group_by(type) |>
  summarise(
    n()
  )
```

**A8: Earthquake is the most common and then quarry blast is the second most common.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q9** How do I calculate the average depth of each type of tremor? What is the average depth of the earthquake type in this data set? Is there anything that seems unusual or surprising in this finding?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  group_by(type) |>
  summarise(average_depth = mean(depth))
```

**A9: The average depth of the earthquake is 25.28. It is surprising that ice quakes are a value of 0.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q10** I'm interested, in the future, to see the hours in which earthquakes happen. How can I extract the hour from the time column?

```{r}
earthquakes <- earthquakes |>
  mutate(hour = hour(time))
```

**A10: You can extract the hour from the time column by creating a new column.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q11** I want to make a note of all the records in this data set that I consider serious. For my purposes, I'm thinking that all tremors that have a magnitude that is larger than 3 are serious. How do I automatically create a new column making that distinction?

```{r}
earthquakes <- earthquakes |>
  mutate(serious = case_when(
    mag > 3 ~ 'Serious',
    .default = 'Not serious'
  ))
```

**A11: We must classify earthquakes with magnitudes at a specific level to be serious or not serious, using the case_when function.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q12** I have no idea how earthquakes work and I'm interested in seeing if there is a particular time of day in which serious earthquakes happen. How can I see that condensed in a table with all the hours in a day and all the serious earthquakes in each hour? What is the hour with fewer serious earthquakes and the one with the most serious earthquakes?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(serious == 'Serious') |>
  group_by(hour) |>
  summarise(
   count = n()
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(count))
```

**A12**: Hour 7 or 17 has the fewest earthquakes - 40 and hour 2 has the most earthquakes - 69.
